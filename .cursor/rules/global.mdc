This is Arcadia, an MCP server in Node.js providing helpful tools for Windows users of Cursor.

<guidelines>
- Use the stdio MCP method.
- When asked to add a rule, edit `.cursor/rules/global.mdc` (this file).
- All .sh scripts should start with `cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )"` to set the working directory to the script's containing directory, then navigate from that known location.
- Always use the local Node.js and npm installations from the `node/` folder in the project root. Node.js and npm are NOT installed globally in the system - they must be run from the local `node/` directory as `node/node.exe` and `node/npm.exe`.
- Never use `npx`. In your scripts, add the local `node/` folder to $PATH. Always call node/npm via your scripts.
  ```
  cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )"
  cd ..
  export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/node
  ```
- When installing new packages, run `scripts/clean.sh` and `scripts/init.sh`, don't run npm yourself.
</guidelines>

<information>
- If you see `[200~` in a bash error, it's a tool bug; we don't have xterm bracketed-paste on Windows.
- Documentation for the MCP TypeScript SDK and the MCP protocol are in `context/` and indexed. Use your codebase search tool.
