This is Arcadia, an MCP server in Node.js providing helpful tools for Windows users of Cursor.

<guidelines>
- Use the stdio MCP method.
- When asked to add a rule, edit `.cursor/rules/global.mdc` (this file).
- All .sh scripts should start with `cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )"` to set the working directory to the script's containing directory, then navigate from that known location.
</guidelines>

<information>
- If you see `[200~` in a bash error, it's a tool bug; we don't have xterm bracketed-paste on Windows.
