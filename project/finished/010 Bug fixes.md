- [x] Fix SQL Server collation conflict in describe_database_object test
    - *ðŸ¤– Fixed by adding `COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT` to all string expressions in the UNION ALL query in the SQL Server describe_database_object implementation. The error was caused by different collations being used in the UNION ALL operator between system function results and column data. The fix ensures all strings use the same collation.*
- [x] database.ts -- you are saving the raw JSON output from Database.exe to the `permanentOutputFile`. That's wrong, you need to save the _formatted JSONL_ output, which is the format that we return in the MCP response to the MCP client. Otherwise the paging doesn't work at all. The paging is based on lines. You need to format it as JSONL before writing to the log file so that the JSONL is what gets paged when the client calls `read_output`. Make sure that all database MCP tools are writing JSONL to the log file and then simply truncating that in the MCP tool response.
  - ðŸ¤– *Fixed by moving the `formatDatabaseOutputAsJsonl` function to `utils.ts` and modifying `runDatabaseCommand` in `database.ts` to format the raw JSON output as JSONL before saving it to the permanent log file. The function still returns the raw JSON in the `output` field so the MCP tools can format it for their responses, but the permanent log file now contains JSONL format for proper paging.*
