- [x] In `server/`, for every MCP tool call we receive (even ones that fail), log the request first in pretty printed JSON format to a fresh .log file in the storage dir, before executing the tool call.
  - *ðŸ¤– Implemented a `logToolCallRequest()` function that creates unique timestamped .log files using `generateTimestampedFilename()` from the storage module. Added logging call at the beginning of the `CallToolRequestSchema` handler before any processing. Logs include timestamp, request type, and full request data in pretty-printed JSON format. Visible in action during test runs.*
- [x] `dotnet/Logs`: When switching from one log file to the next one, take one final look at the previous log file to get any last lines that you may have missed. If we write the last lines to one log file and then immediately start a new log file, we're missing those last lines. If a series of log files are all created in between one check and the next, print the entirety of all of them. It is a "catchup" process.
    - _ðŸ¤– Implemented catchup functionality by adding two new methods: `CatchupPreviousFile()` performs a final read of the previous log file from the current position to end, and `CatchupIntermediateFiles()` handles any log files created between the previous and new current file. The file switching logic now calls both methods before switching to ensure no lines are missed._
