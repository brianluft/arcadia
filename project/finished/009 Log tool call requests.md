- [x] In `server/`, for every MCP tool call we receive (even ones that fail), log the request first in pretty printed JSON format to a fresh .log file in the storage dir, before executing the tool call.
  - *ðŸ¤– Implemented a `logToolCallRequest()` function that creates unique timestamped .log files using `generateTimestampedFilename()` from the storage module. Added logging call at the beginning of the `CallToolRequestSchema` handler before any processing. Logs include timestamp, request type, and full request data in pretty-printed JSON format. Visible in action during test runs.*
