- [x] Ensure all database MCP tools return _JSONL_ and not a straight JSON array. That is, there's no "outer" array. Every array element gets its own line in the response and is a self-contained JSON object that can be parsed on its own. This way, truncated results don't mess up the overall JSON because each individual line is valid JSON.
    - ðŸ¤– _Created a helper function `formatDatabaseOutputAsJsonl()` that converts the C# database program's CSV-style JSON array format `[["headers"], [row1], [row2], ...]` into JSONL format where each row becomes a separate JSON object on its own line. Applied this conversion to all database tools: `list_database_schemas`, `list_database_objects` (both SQLite and SQL Server branches), `describe_database_object` (both branches), and updated `run_sql_command` to use the helper. Also updated test expectations to match the new JSONL format._
- [ ] Add a series of SQL Server tests to our real-deal test MCP client in `test/`. Selectively skipped. Only run them if `$ARCADIA_CONFIG_FILE` (we already require this to be set globally in order to run our real-deal test harness) points to a `config.jsonc` that contains an SQL Server connection named "test" (i.e. `config.connections.sqlServer.test`). If not, skip them. They will be skipped in CI but I have a SQL Server configuration locally. The tests must work on any database that has some tables already, but the test doesn't hardcode any database, schema, or table names so it works on arbitrary databases.
    - [ ] `list_database_schemas`: Test that it succeeds and returns at least one result.
    - [ ] `list_database_objects`: Test that it succeeds and returns at least one result.
    - [ ] `describe_database_object`: First run `list_database_objects`, grab the first result, and then test `describe_database_object` on that result.
    - [ ] `run_sql_command`: Test `SELECT 1 AS foo`
