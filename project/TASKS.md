- [ ] `dotnet/Logs`: When switching from one log file to the next one, take one final look at the previous log file to get any last lines that you may have missed. If we write the last lines to one log file and then immediately start a new log file, we're missing those last lines. If a series of log files are all created in between one check and the next, print the entirety of all of them. It is a "catchup" process.
