# Warning fixes
- [x] Fix this build warning: `warning NETSDK1194: The "--output" option isn't supported when building a solution. Specifying a solution-level output path results in all projects copying outputs to the same directory, which can lead to inconsistent builds.`. We will fix it by enabling artifacts output in the default path and then copying the outputs into `build/dotnet/` ourselves.
    - Add `<UseArtifactsOutput>true</UseArtifactsOutput>` to `Database.csproj` and `Logs.csproj`
    - This will cause the build outputs to go to a different path. Figure it out and copy the output files yourself into `build/dotnet/`, overwriting files as needed because we _want_ them to share .NET files.
    - Get `build.sh` and `publish.sh` working again without the NETSDK1194 warning.
    - _ðŸ¤– Fixed by creating `dotnet/Directory.Build.props` with `<UseArtifactsOutput>true</UseArtifactsOutput>` (can't be in project files due to NETSDK1199), removed `--output` parameters from build commands, and updated `scripts/build.sh` to copy from `artifacts/bin/[Project]/debug/*` (development) or `artifacts/publish/[Project]/release/*` (release) to `build/dotnet/`. Build now succeeds with 0 warnings._
- [x] Fix this test warning: "Skipping read-only directory test (not supported on this platform)" -- don't log anything in that case.
    - _ðŸ¤– Fixed by removing the `console.log('Skipping read-only directory test (not supported on this platform)');` statement from `server/src/__tests__/storage.test.ts` line 60. The test still skips properly on Windows but no longer generates output._
