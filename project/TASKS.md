- [ ] database.ts -- you are saving the raw JSON output from Database.exe to the `permanentOutputFile`. That's wrong, you need to save the _formatted JSONL_ output, which is the format that we return in the MCP response to the MCP client. Otherwise the paging doesn't work at all. The paging is based on lines. You need to format it as JSONL before writing to the log file so that the JSONL is what gets paged when the client calls `read_output`. Make sure that all database MCP tools are writing JSONL to the log file and then simply truncating that in the MCP tool response.
